# iteusc-website

A new website for ITE at USC.

## Why this project?

ITE at USC desperately needs a new website, and I love Svelte :-)

## What is this project?

This project is a new website for ITE at USC. It is built with Svelte, and promotes our club. It pulls data on transportation opportunities, etc. from our Firebase Realtime DB.
