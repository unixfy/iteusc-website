# iteusc-website

A new website for ITE at USC.

## What is this project?

This project is a new website for ITE at USC. It is built with Svelte, and promotes our club. It pulls data on transportation opportunities, etc. from our Directus database.

Functionality in scope:

- Provide attractive and interesting information to people who may be curious about USC ITE, or are interested in joining
- Offer a fast experience, even on slow internet connections: target 90+ on Google Lighthouse
- All end-user facing interactions should work 100% without JavaScript (leverage SvelteKit SSR for this!)
- Provide a simple and intuitive UI for non-technical users to view, edit, and update (i.e., perform create-read-update-delete operations) on the website's content
- Maintain data integrity when writing data to and reading data from the Cloud Firestore database
